# Credit-Card-Approval
Credit cards are one of the most commonly used financial tools. However, obtaining a credit card can be a difficult task for many individuals due to various factors such as  income level, and employment status. To help streamline the application process and improve the approval rate, machine learning models can be used to predict credit card approval. In this project, we will explore how various factors affect credit card approval rates and use predictive models to improve the accuracy of credit card approval predictions.
